# Spam-Email-Classifier
I create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In this project, we demonstrated:
• Feature engineering with text data

• Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models

• Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting

• Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
